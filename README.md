# mojo-syntax

This repository contains a TextMate grammar for the Mojo ðŸ”¥ programming
language.

# Contributing

The Mojo syntax has been converted from [MagicPython.tmLanguage][1]. Many fixes
or improvements to Mojo's syntax also apply to Python, so in many cases,
creating a pull request against the original repository is the way to go. Once
accepted there, we'd be happy to receive an update request.

For Mojo-specific updates, we'd be happy to review pull requests sent here.
Please include a description of the problem that the change addresses.

General issues with Mojo or how its syntax is highlighted on GitHub can be
reported to the main Mojo repository [here][2].
